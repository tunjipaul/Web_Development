        <h1>ABOUT ME!!!</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I'm Ogor Paul Olatunji, Software Developer/Product Manager</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, I've served in leadership roles—<b>Hall Chairman, FUNAABSU (2024/2025) and Welfare
                Director, FUNAABSUHOR (2022/2023)</b>—where I focused on welfare, advocacy, and building systems that
            improve student life. These experiences shaped me into a collaborative leader who thrives on driving
            initiatives that make a tangible difference.
            In 2024, I began my AI and programming journey through the <strong> Ogun State Ministry of Science and
                Technology's</strong> initiative led by <b>Dr. Bosun Tijani</b>. Since then, I've been learning
            <em>Python, Git/GitHub, and software design principles</em>, while building small projects that sharpen my
            skills. I'm especially interested in how AI and product development can be applied to education, community
            growth, and social innovation.
            As a member of Enactus, I've worked on projects that emphasize innovation and entrepreneurship for social
            good—further fueling my belief that technology should create opportunities and empower people.
            I'm on a path of continuous learning, blending my leadership background with technical expertise to grow
            into a product-focused professional who builds tools and systems that scale impact.
